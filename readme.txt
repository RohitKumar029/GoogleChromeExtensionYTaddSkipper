Google Chrome extension developed to click automatically the "Skip Ad" button before the countdown timer reaches 0. 
This is very fast, you cannot see when an add is started and in the same time it is not against the YouTube terms of service.
Furthermore this is possible by querying the button every 100 milliseconds using the setInterval() function.
Hence, it allows the code to check if the "Skip Ad" button exists and click it immediately when it appears.
setInterval() is a JavaScript function that executes a function or code snippet at a specified interval (in milliseconds). 
In this case, the function queries the "Skip Ad" button every 100 milliseconds and clicks it, if it is found.

To use the extension execute the following steps:

1. Open the Chrome browser on your computer.

2. Click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the window to open the Chrome menu.

3. Click on "More tools" and then select "Extensions" from the drop-down menu.

4. In the extensions page, click on the "Load unpacked" button.

5. In the file explorer window that appears, navigate to the folder where you saved the extension files and select it.

6. The extension will now be installed in your browser, and you should see it listed under "Extensions" in the Chrome menu.

7. To use the extension, simply click on its icon in the browser toolbar. The extension should now be able to perform the tasks it was programmed to do.


Enjoy! :)
